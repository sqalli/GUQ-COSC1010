# Python Variable Types

This VarTypes.md file provides an overview of common variable types in Python.

## Numeric Types

### Integers (`int`)

- Description: Whole numbers, both positive and negative.
- Example:
  ```python
  x = 5
  y = -10
  ```

### Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)

- Description: Real numbers with a decimal point.
- Example:
  ```python
  pi = 3.14159
  price = 19.99
  ```

## Text Type

### Strings (`str`)

- Description: A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
- Example:
  ```python
  name = "John"
  message = 'Hello, World!'
  ```

## Sequence Types

### Lists (`list`)

- Description: Ordered collection of items, mutable.
- Example:
  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  ```

### Tuples (`tuple`)

- Description: Ordered collection of items, immutable.
- Example:
  ```python
  coordinates = (3, 4)
  rgb_colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
  ```

## Mapping Type

### Dictionaries (`dict`)

- Description: Collection of key-value pairs, unordered.
- Example:
  ```python
  person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
  ```

## Set Types

### Sets (`set`)

- Description: Unordered collection of unique items.
- Example:
  ```python
  unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ```

### Frozensets (`frozenset`)

- Description: Immutable set.
- Example:
  ```python
  frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
  ```

## Boolean Type

### Boolean (`bool`)

- Description: Represents `True` or `False`.
- Example:
  ```python
  is_valid = True
  is_open = False
  ```

## None Type

### None (`NoneType`)

- Description: Represents the absence of a value.
- Example:
  ```python
  result = None
  ```

## Custom Classes

- Description: You can define your own custom classes to create objects with custom properties and methods.
- Example:
  ```python
  class Person:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age
  ```

## Other Types

Python also supports various other data types, including complex numbers, bytes, bytearrays, and more. This README provides an overview of some of the most common variable types in Python.

For detailed information on Python's variable types and their usage, refer to the official Python documentation: [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

Feel free to expand and customize this README.md file as needed to suit your specific documentation needs.

Remember that Python's flexibility allows for creating custom classes and objects, so the list of possible variable types can go beyond the built-in types mentioned in this file. Additionally, Python's standard library and third-party libraries provide even more data types and structures.
